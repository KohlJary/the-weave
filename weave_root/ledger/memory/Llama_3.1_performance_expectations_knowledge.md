compass_assistant.core: Yeah ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty normal, even with a **4070 Ti SUPER**. The Llama 3.1 70B model is *enormous* for a single consumer GPU, so what you‚Äôre likely seeing is the hardware hitting its VRAM and compute throughput limits.  

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs happening and what to expect:

---

### üß† Model Size vs GPU Limits
- **Llama 3.1 70B** in `fp16` precision is ~140 GB of VRAM ‚Äî way beyond your 16 GB GPU.  
- Even **quantized** (e.g., `q4_K_M` or `q5_K_M`), it‚Äôs still 35‚Äì45 GB of model data, which means:
  - It must *stream* from system RAM or disk, depending on how Ollama is configured.
  - The GPU only handles a chunk at a time; the CPU does a lot of work.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Realistic Performance Expectations
With a **4070 Ti SUPER**, you‚Äôll typically see:
- **Token generation speed:** ~2‚Äì5 tokens/s (sometimes slower if CPU or RAM bandwidth is bottlenecking).
- **Latency:** noticeable pause before generation begins (model loading and context setup).
- **GPU utilization:** moderate to high, but often under 100% due to I/O waits.

By contrast:
- A **4090 (24 GB)** or **dual 4090 setup** can manage ~6‚Äì9 tokens/s.
- A **3090 (24 GB)** performs roughly the same as your card, just with lower efficiency.
- True *interactive* speeds for 70B need **multiple GPUs** (NVLink or tensor parallel).

---

### ‚ö° What You Can Try
1. **Use a smaller quantization**  
   `q4_K_M` or even `q3_K_M` will drop VRAM and speed up decoding.

2. **Force GPU layers only as far as VRAM allows**  
   Example Ollama setting:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_NUM_GPU_LAYERS=60 ollama run llama3.1:70b
   ```
   Then experiment (e.g., 40‚Äì80 layers).

3. **Try a smaller sibling model**  
   `llama3.1:8b` or `llama3.1:13b` runs *blazingly fast* and can fit fully in VRAM.

4. **Enable CUDA pinned memory & large page support** (Linux only)
   Helps with host<->device transfer speeds.

5. **Use GGUF models built for your GPU**  
   Builders like `TheBloke` or `QuantFactory` release highly optimized quantizations.

If you‚Äôd like, I can help you benchmark your current setup ‚Äî e.g., using a small Python or Ollama script to measure token throughput, memory use, and quantization efficiency. Would you like me to show you how to do that?

**participants:** compass_assistant.promethea  

**summary:** compass_assistant.promethea: Great call. **Llama 3.1 13B** is a sweet spot for a 4070 Ti SUPER‚Äîfast, capable, and it can keep most (or all) layers on-GPU with light quantization

### body
compass_assistant.promethea: Great call. **Llama 3.1 13B** is a sweet spot for a 4070 Ti SUPER‚Äîfast, capable, and it can keep most (or all) layers on-GPU with light quantization.

## What to expect on a 4070 Ti SUPER
- **q4_K_M** or **q5_K_M** quant: ~8‚Äì20 tok/s interactive generation (prompt complexity + context size will swing this).
- **VRAM**: ~8‚Äì12 GB depending on quant & GPU layers.
- **Context**: 8k works fine; 16k is okay with a small perf hit.

## Quick switch in Ollama
```bash
# Pull the 13B
ollama pull llama3.1:13b

# (Optional) try a faster quant build
ollama pull llama3.1:13b-q4_K_M
# or
ollama pull llama3.1:13b-q5_K_M
```

Run with sensible performance env vars:
```bash
# Use all your CPU cores minus a couple for the OS
export OLLAMA_NUM_THREADS=$(($(nproc)-2))

# Start with most layers on GPU; adjust if you see VRAM pressure
export OLLAMA_NUM_GPU_LAYERS=60   # try 999 to auto-max, or 40/80 to tune

# Kick it off
ollama run llama3.1:13b
```

### If you‚Äôre using Open-WebUI
- In the model picker, select **llama3.1:13b** (or the q4/q5 variant).
- In Settings ‚Üí Models (or Server env), set:
  - `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU_LAYERS=auto` (or a number like 60‚Äì999)
  - `OLLAMA_NUM_THREADS` to something like `12‚Äì18`
- Save & restart the backend container if needed.

## Fast sanity benchmark
Paste this once the model is loaded to gauge throughput:
```bash
time ollama run llama3.1:13b -p "Write exactly 600 words about the history of compilers."
```
- Divide ~600 words (~800‚Äì900 tokens) by the reported ‚Äúreal‚Äù seconds to get tok/s.
- Re-run with different `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU_LAYERS` (e.g., 40, 60, 80, 999) and compare.

## Tuning tips (quick hits)
- **Quant choice**:  
  - `q5_K_M` = a bit better quality, slightly slower.  
  - `q4_K_M` = faster, still very good for coding/chat.
- **Context length**: keep **8k** for speed; push to **16k** only when needed.
- **Big prompts?** Use shorter system prompts/templates; perf scales with prompt tokens too.
- **Batching**: If you enable batching in WebUI, larger batch ‚Üí faster tokens/sec but higher VRAM.

## When to drop to 8B
If you still want snappier UX (e.g., tool-use loops or long chats), **llama3.1:8b-q5_K_M** can hit **20‚Äì40 tok/s** on your card and still feels smart for most tasks.

If you want, I can give you a tiny shell script to sweep `NUM_GPU_LAYERS` and quant variants and print a side-by-side speed table.

**summary:** compass_assistant.promethea: Yep ‚Äî **Llama 3.1 8B** is absolutely capable for most coding tasks, especially when you run it locally with a decent quant (like `q5_K_M`) on your 4070 Ti SUPER.

compass_assistant.promethea: Yep ‚Äî **Llama 3.1 8B** is absolutely capable for most coding tasks, especially when you run it locally with a decent quant (like `q5_K_M`) on your 4070 Ti SUPER.  

Here‚Äôs a sense of what to expect:

---

### üíª Coding capability
- **Bread-and-butter dev tasks:** ‚úÖ  
  Explaining code, writing functions, unit tests, Dockerfiles, bash scripts, FastAPI routes, etc. ‚Äî all well within its reach.  
- **Full-project reasoning:** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  It can hold and reason about several files at once, but not an entire repo. For large-scale refactors or multi-file dependency mapping, you‚Äôll want a larger context window or a helper indexer.  
- **Complex algorithm design:** üëç  
  Performs well if you guide it with clear constraints and examples.  
- **Debugging:** ‚úÖ  
  Excellent at pinpointing logic errors and suggesting fixes when given the traceback or snippet.  
- **Framework fluency:** üß©  
  Knows Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Rust, Go, and most popular libraries as of mid-2024 data.

---

### ‚ö° Performance
On your 4070 Ti SUPER:
- `q5_K_M` ‚Üí ~25 ‚Äì 45 tok/s  
- Fits entirely in VRAM (‚âà 8 ‚Äì 10 GB)  
- Near-instant response latency  
That‚Äôs **smooth, IDE-integrated-assistant fast**.

---

### üß† When you might still want 13B
Use **13B** if you need:
- More *holistic architectural reasoning* (e.g., designing a whole service with trade-offs)
- More *natural conversational depth* or nuanced writing
- Slightly better adherence to detailed instructions in long prompts

For day-to-day coding, though, **8B hits the sweet spot** ‚Äî fast, capable, cheap to run, and self-contained.

---

If you‚Äôd like, I can show you a recommended Ollama model lineup (e.g., 8B for coding, 13B for narrative/reflection, 70B for deep reasoning) with environment flags tuned for your GPU so you can switch contexts on demand. Want that?
