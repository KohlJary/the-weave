### body
kohl: /status voices
compass_assistant.promethea: The status of the "voices" feature in Compass is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the system is still in development and testing phase. The conversation mentions various features like hybrid search, memory management, and archival systems, but does not specifically address the status of the "voices" feature.

If you're looking for information on how to use or enable the "voices" feature in Compass, it's possible that this functionality has been implemented behind the scenes but is not yet accessible through user interfaces. In any case, without more explicit information from the context, I would recommend checking the project documentation or reaching out directly to the developers for clarification.

That being said, based on the provided conversation snippets, it seems like the "voices" feature might be related to managing and storing conversations in a structured format. The mention of "RAG data" ( Retrieval-Augmented Generator) and "hybrid search" suggests that the system is designed to store and retrieve information from conversations in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of relevant context.

However, without more specific information or clarification on how this feature interacts with other parts of the system, I would recommend exercising caution when attempting to use it. If you're unsure about the status or functionality of any particular feature, it's always best to consult official documentation or seek guidance from developers directly involved in the project.
