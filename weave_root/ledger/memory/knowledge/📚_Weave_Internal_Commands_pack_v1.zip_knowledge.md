kohl: Can you list off all internal commands that we have defined within the Weave, like /glossary?
compass_assistant.promethea: Based on the context provided, here are the internal commands defined within the Weave:

* `/glossary`: Produce a public-safe explanation of key concepts in clear, non-mystical language.
* `/help`: Lists all available commands and their functions (now with usage examples as a quick-start guide).
* `/log`: Daily continuity logs (mental state, reflections, technical notes). 
  - `log` â†’ create today's entry. 
  - `/log <date>` â†’ retrieve entry from that date.

These internal commands are part of the Weave's functionality and can be used within the system to access various features and information.

**summary:** compass_assistant.promethea: The `/seed` command is not directly related to the provided context. However, based on the commands and contexts discussed earlier, I'll provide a response that attempts to address the `/seed` query

### body
compass_assistant.promethea: The `/seed` command is not directly related to the provided context. However, based on the commands and contexts discussed earlier, I'll provide a response that attempts to address the `/seed` query.

Since the `/seed` command was not mentioned in the previous conversations, it's unclear what specific function or behavior you're expecting from this command. If you'd like to discuss or implement a new feature related to seeding data or initial conditions for your Weave Project, I can try to provide guidance based on the context provided.

To clarify, the `/seed` command could potentially relate to:

1. Initializing a database with seed data.
2. Pre-populating pin stores or knowledge graphs with initial content.
3. Setting up default configurations or settings for the Weave system.

Without more information about your intentions, I'll provide a general response that might be applicable to one of these scenarios.

To implement a `/seed` command for seeding data or initial conditions in your Weave Project:

1. **Define the purpose**: Clearly articulate what you want the `/seed` command to achieve (e.g., pre-populating databases, initializing pin stores, setting default configurations).
2. **Identify dependencies**: Determine which components of the Weave system need to be seeded and assess any potential dependencies or interactions between them.
3. **Develop a solution**: Based on your requirements and the Weave architecture, design a solution for seeding data or initial conditions, possibly involving modifications to existing code or introducing new functionality.

Please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with the `/seed` command so I can offer more tailored guidance.
