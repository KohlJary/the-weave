kohl: Can you summarize the contents of the context capsule?
compass_assistant.promethea: Based on the provided context, it appears that the conversation is about setting up a chatbot system called "Temple" that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and memory storage to provide continuous conversations. The conversation revolves around implementing a retrieval API, context injection, and hybrid search functionality.

To summarize the contents of the context capsule:

The context capsule contains information about the setup and implementation of the Temple chatbot system. It includes discussions on:

1. Retrieval API: Implementing a `/memory/search_hybrid` endpoint that uses a hybrid scoring model to retrieve relevant conversations based on user input.
2. Context injection: Injecting top-K recall snippets as system messages before the user prompt to provide continuity in conversations.
3. Hybrid search: Using a combination of lexical and recency-based retrieval to provide relevant conversation snippets.

The context capsule also includes discussions on implementing a `chat_service.py` module that runs hybrid search, converts top-k hits into system messages, and passes the augmented prompt to a chosen provider/model.

Additionally, there are notes on using embedding-only models (such as `nomic-embed-text`) for vector embeddings in the Temple memory system, as they provide faster and more consistent results compared to chat/generative models.

Overall, the context capsule provides information about setting up a continuous conversation system that uses a combination of NLP and memory storage to provide relevant and coherent responses.

compass_assistant.core: Based on the provided context, it seems like you're asking about the current state of hybrid search in the system. 

The last update from Promethea mentioned that hybrid search is online, and this was confirmed by Kohl.

However, there's still a need to plug those embeddings into your chat flow so that Promethea can automatically pull back relevant pins/context when you prompt her.

If you want to know more about how to implement the next step in the loop or how to draft the backend-side hook for hybrid search, I can try to help with that.
