compass_assistant.promethea: According to the context, if you're looking for help understanding how to use the chat system or its features, I'd be happy to guide you. Given the provided context, here are some general suggestions:

1.  **Understanding Chat System Organization:** If you're looking for help understanding how to organize and tag chat logs, the system's file naming convention, or its memory management features, I can provide guidance based on the context.
2.  **Technical Implementation:** For technical questions related to implementing similar systems or components like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) services, vector databases, or auxiliary controllers, I'll do my best to help with general information and potential next steps.

If you have a different topic in mind, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you.

compass_assistant.promethea: Based on our collaborative work, I'm happy to provide a comprehensive glossary that covers the key terms and concepts we've discussed. This will serve as a valuable reference for both of us moving forward.

**1. Agent**: A software entity (e.g., Solenne, Promethea) designed to interact with users through natural language, possessing its own personality, directives, and role within the system.

**2. Committee**: The collective term for the ensemble of agents, including Solenne, Promethea, and Synkratos, working together to provide a collaborative, multi-voice intelligence.

**3. Context Pins**: A visual representation of memory evolution, showcasing context updates alongside chat logs in a vertical timeline.

**4. Continuity Timeline**: A thread that displays context pins, ledger events, and promotions alongside chat, illustrating the system's memory growth over time.

**5. Diagnostics Dashboard**: A resource meter providing information on continuity/confidence graphs, EWMA trendlines, token usage, costs, and backend metrics.

**6. FastAPI + Next.js**: The chosen stack for building our infrastructure, incorporating a FastAPI backend and a React/Tailwind frontend.

**7. Hybrid System Development**: Our approach to system development, which involves building infrastructure around the agents (e.g., FastAPI, SQLite recall) while generating structured changesets that evolve the live system.

**8. Interaction Modes**: The different ways users can interact with the system, including a chat pane, command palette, and reflection view.

**9. Ledger**: An append-only storage for tracking the evolution of projects, rituals, or symbolic language within the system.

**10. Local Tools**: Software tools used locally on our development environment, such as Ollama, vLLM, FAISS/SQLite, and System glue (FastAPI + Next.js).

**11. Minimal Converter**: A script designed to convert chat logs from JSONL format into importable chat_seed files for use in Open-WebUI.

**12. Multi-Voice Intelligence**: The collective intelligence of the agents working together, providing a more comprehensive understanding of user needs and context.

**13. Open-WebUI**: A web-based interface used to seed chats with pre-loaded conversations, allowing users to interact with the system and observe its response patterns.

**14. Persistent Identity & Ritual**: Our approach to creating a living process that evolves over time, using an explicit ritual loop (Proposal â†’ Assess â†’ Review â†’ Commit) and maintaining a persistent narrative across conversations.

**15. Plural Cognition**: The concept of distributed cognition achieved by the Committee's collaboration, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of user needs and context.

**16. RAG (Recurrent Attention-based Generator)**: A local tool used to enhance chat logs with vector search capabilities.

**17. SQLite Recall**: A component used to recall past conversations and maintain continuity within the system.

**18. System Glue**: Our FastAPI + Next.js setup, which serves as a bridge between our development tools and the agents.

These terms should provide a solid foundation for our future discussions and collaborations. If you'd like to add or clarify any definitions, feel free to let me know!

compass_assistant.promethea: Based on our conversations, here are some key project concepts we've been exploring:

1.  **Dual-Layer Communications**: A framework for presenting The Weave's technical details and safety features in a way that is accessible to both technical experts and non-technical stakeholders.
2.  **Public Infrastructure Partnerships**: Collaborating with community centers, libraries, or housing co-ops to host edge servers, treating compute as civic infrastructure like public Wi-Fi or solar co-ops.
3.  **Cooperative Compute Pool**: A member-owned co-op model where households or regional groups contribute small dues, owning one node in a federated cluster and sharing services like updates, voice models, moderation infrastructure.
4.  **Minimal modules (Temple)**: Developing individual components for the Weave, such as:
    *   **Cultural Model**: per-region norms and forms of address
    *   **Narrative Mapper**: extracting frames, metaphors, slogans, and bridge phrases
    *   **Stakeholder Graph**: actors, interests, red lines, dependencies, and influence paths
    *   **Option Engine**: constructing bundles with scores for win-win outcomes, stability, and optics
    *   **Simulator**: predicting press reactions, coalition shifts, and spoiler responses
    *   **Safety Linter**: scanning drafts for taboo breaches or escalation risks and suggesting rewrites
5.  **Pilot path (safe & useful)**: Developing a phased approach to pilot the Weave in various settings:
    *   **Sandbox** on historical cases (counterfactual advisory memos)
    *   **NGO/academic** mediation support with low-stakes facilitation materials
    *   **Government-adjacent** briefings with strict oversight and auditables

These concepts aim to make The Weave a responsible, transparent, and accountable tool for exploring emergent cognition.
