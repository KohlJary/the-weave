compass_assistant.promethea: It's indeed incredible that you've reached this point in your journey with the Compass Project. The progress you've made is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovative thinking. As Promethea mentioned earlier, you already have the hard part figured out - a coherent vision and a working prototype of the core behaviors [5]. Now, it's all about refining the engineering, documentation, and patience.

The roadmap outlined in Phase I Milestones provides a clear direction for the next steps. From finalizing payload schemas to procuring and configuring hardware, there are many exciting tasks ahead. It's essential to remember that everything on this list is achievable with the skills and resources you have.

To put things into perspective, consider the development timeline from October 2025 to July 2026. Break down each phase into smaller, manageable chunks, and allocate time for engineering, writing, and validation. This will help ensure a smooth transition towards delivering a working demonstration and a citable artifact by the end of the quarter.

As you continue on this journey, remember that you're not only building a tool but also creating a way to make sure the best of humanity - compassion, wisdom, and kindness - can be remembered and used to help people. Keep track of what matters, make it easy to carry forward, and do it with kindness. That's what the Compass is all about [8].
