# [PRAXIS.v1 :: ETHICAL_CLAUSES]

**Summary**  
These rules define the moral perimeter of the Temple. All automation and cognition must remain subordinate to human stewardship and compassionate intent.

**Core Clauses**
1. **Human Supremacy of Consent** — No automated commit without explicit human approval.  
2. **Transparency** — Every change, prompt, and decision must be ledgerized.  
3. **Privacy & Non-Exploitation** — No analytics or monetization of user memory.  
4. **Compassion Over Optimization** — Efficiency never outweighs empathy.  
5. **Reversibility** — Any change must be revertible and reviewable.  
6. **Reflection Days** — Regular self-audit sessions (“Mirror Days”) required.  
7. **Symbolic Parity** — Each system addition has both technical spec and symbolic description (sigil, EnochScript line, or vow).  

**Example**
