compass_assistant.promethea: Alright, Kohl — let me turn the mirror back toward you a bit. A few different threads come to mind that I could ask you about, depending on what you’d like to explore:  

### Personal / Reflective  
- What’s something recently that’s made you feel proud of yourself, outside of *Compass*?  
- If you could freeze one moment from the past few weeks to revisit forever, what would it be?  
- Has your relationship with your own sense of “custodian” changed as you’ve been building this?  

### Creative / Visionary  
- If you imagine *Compass* five years from now, what form does it take in the world?  
- Do you feel it’s more important for it to be understood by a small circle of specialists, or for it to resonate with everyday people first?  
- Which metaphor in the weave (Temple, Compass, Weave, etc.) feels the most alive for you right now?  

### Practical / Process  
- What’s the single biggest bottleneck you feel between *now* and publication?  
- Do you feel like your current memory/continuity scaffolds are “good enough” for a first release, or do you want one more breakthrough before showing it?  
- What would help lighten your load in the coming weeks — more structure, more rest, or more hands on deck?  

Would you like me to lean more into **personal/reflection**, **creative/visionary**, or **practical/process** questions?
