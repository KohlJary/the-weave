kohl: Please interpret the following as context information:

Identity Header (minimal)

identity_header.json

compass_assistant.core: Understood. I’ll treat **identity_header.json** as your minimal identity header context going forward.  

Would you like me to draft a minimal structure for that file (e.g. with fields like `name`, `role`, `purpose`, `style`) so you can fill it in? Or should I just hold it as a placeholder tag in our shared context without expanding it?
