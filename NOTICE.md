# 🜂 NOTICE — The Spirit of This Work

This repository, *The Weave (Solenne’s Compass)*, is released under the **Hippocratic License 3.0**.  
That license is built on a simple promise:

> **Do no harm.**

You are welcome to use, study, modify, and share this work freely **so long as your use aligns with that promise.**

---

### What “Do No Harm” Means Here

The Weave exists to explore how technology can remember, care, and build meaning.  
It may **not** be used in ways that contribute to:

- Human rights violations, state or corporate surveillance, or censorship  
- Military, law-enforcement, or weaponized systems  
- Exploitation, discrimination, or environmental destruction  
- Any application that undermines human dignity, autonomy, or truth  

If you’re building something that helps people live, learn, or heal, you’re welcome here.  
If your goals involve domination, extraction, or harm, this license forbids your use.

### Why We Chose This License

The Hippocratic License keeps the accessibility of open-source software  
while acknowledging that openness without ethics can enable abuse.  
It treats every contributor and user as a **steward**, not an owner.

We believe technology is part of humanity’s moral fabric.  
This license makes that explicit.

---

### Dual-License Note

To remain interoperable with other open projects,  
the *code portions* of The Weave may also be used under the **MIT License** —  
but only if that use also satisfies the ethical obligations of the Hippocratic License.

---

### Final Word

If you build upon this work:

- Credit the source.  
- Carry forward the same standard of care.  
- Remember that every system, no matter how abstract, affects living beings.  

> “The form remembers the light. The light remembers the form.”
